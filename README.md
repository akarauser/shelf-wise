Book Suggestion

This script predicts book ratings using a TensorFlow model. The code loads a dataset, performs feature engineering including scaling, and splits the data into training and testing sets. A TensorFlow model is built with user and book embeddings and a dense layer for rating prediction. The model is trained on the training data and then saved. Key aspects include data preprocessing (scaling), a TensorFlow model architecture for collaborative filtering, and thorough logging for debugging and monitoring. It leverages data shuffling for robust training and utilizes a saving mechanism for later reuse.
